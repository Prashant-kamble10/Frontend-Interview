Highest Occurring Element in an Array

Given an array of n integers, find the most frequent element in it i.e.,
the element that occurs the maximum number of times. If there are multiple elements that appear a maximum number of times,
find the smallest of them.

Examples:
Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The number 3 appears the most (3 times). It is the most frequent element.

Input: arr = [4, 4, 5, 5, 6]
Output: 4
Explanation: Both 4 and 5 appear twice, but 4 is smaller. So, 4 is the most frequent element.

Input: arr = [10, 9 ,7]
Output:7
