🤔 Array ?
🅰️ array starts with zero indexing, In array we are not sure where will zeroth index will get store(In which address location), but we are sure index 1,2 & so on will be surely getting stored consequetly beside zeroth index, that is for sure.

2D Array Example:
so below 3 rows & 5 columns are there. 

let arr1 = [4,5,6,7,8]
let arr2 = [2,8,6,9,2]
let arr3 = [1,4,3,5,7]

⚠️ it is Index, so we can add some value to existing value or we can replace existing value withh new value.


✅ What a 2D array really is:
A 2D array is an array of arrays — meaning:
It's 1 array, where each element is itself another array.
So it's not 2 arrays, but 1 array whose elements are arrays.

const twoD = [
  [1, 2, 3],  // first row
  [4, 5, 6]   // second row
];
// twoD[0] is [1, 2, 3]

✅ What a 3D array is:
A 3D array is an array whose elements are 2D arrays — it's a nested array of arrays of arrays.
You can think of it as:

A cube of values.
Or a list of 2D matrices.

const threeD = [
  [ // Block 0
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
  ],
  [ // Block 1
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8]
  ]
];
// threeD[1][0][1] → Block 1 → First row → Second item → 6
