ü§î Array ?
üÖ∞Ô∏è array starts with zero indexing, In array we are not sure where will zeroth index will get store(In which address location), but we are sure index 1,2 & so on will be surely getting stored consequetly beside zeroth index, that is for sure.

2D Array Example:
so below 3 rows & 5 columns are there. 

let arr1 = [4,5,6,7,8]
let arr2 = [2,8,6,9,2]
let arr3 = [1,4,3,5,7]

‚ö†Ô∏è it is Index, so we can add some value to existing value or we can replace existing value withh new value.
