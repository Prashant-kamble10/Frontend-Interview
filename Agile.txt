🤔 waterfall model vs Agile methodology
🅰️ ➡️ Waterfall Model: A linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase 
   (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing  → Deployment → Maintenance) is completed before moving to the next.

    ➡️ Agile Model: An iterative and incremental approach where the project is broken into smaller cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback and adaptation. 
    1️⃣ Product Backlog(Requirements Gathering) → 2️⃣ Sprint Planning(Task Breakdown) → 3️⃣ Sprint Execution  (Development & Testing)→  
    4️⃣ Sprint Review(Demo to Stakeholders) → 5️⃣ Sprint Retrospective (Process Improvement) → 🔄 Repeat Next Sprint  (Iterate & Improve)

    Imagine building a house:

    Waterfall Model:
    🏠 Step 1: Plan everything → Step 2: Design the entire blueprint → Step 3: Construct → Step 4: Paint & furnish → Step 5: Move in.
    👉 If a problem arises at the end (e.g., a wrong window size), fixing it is costly.

    Agile Model:
    🏠 Build one room at a time, get feedback, and improve in small steps. If the customer dislikes the paint color, you can change it before painting the next room.
    👉 Iterative adjustments make it flexible and responsive to changes.


    | Feature                   | Waterfall Model                           | Agile Model |
       
    | Approach                  | 	Sequential                              | Iterative & Incremental  |
    | Flexibility               | Rigid, changes are costly                 | 	Highly flexible  |
    | Customer Involvement      | Only at the beginning & end               | Continuous feedback  |
    | Testing                   | 	Done after implementation               | Done in every sprint  |
    | Delivery                  | One-time, final product                   | Frequent releases  |
    | Risk Handling             | High (late-stage issues are expensive)    | Lower (early issue detection)  |

    ❌ Don't say Agile is always better.
    ✅ Say "It depends on project needs" and discuss the trade-offs.
