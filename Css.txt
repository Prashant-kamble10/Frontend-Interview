ü§î How to center a div ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è multiple ways to center a div
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Using flexbox
    .parent {
       display: flex;
       justify-content: center;  /* Centers horizontally */
       align-items: center;      /* Centers vertically */
       height: 100vh;            /* Full viewport height */
     }
     Edge Case: If the parent has no defined height, align-items: center; won‚Äôt work.

     2Ô∏è‚É£ using grid
         .parent{
            display: grid;
            place-items: center;   /* Centers both horizontally and vertically */
            height: 100vh;
         }
      Edge Case: Requires a height for the parent container.

      3Ô∏è‚É£ Using position: absolute + transform
          .child{
            position: absolute;
              top: 50%;
              left: 50%;
              transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
          }
        Edge Case: If the parent is not position: relative;, the child may center relative to the <body>
  
        üòÆ Mention responsive considerations (e.g., using min-height instead of fixed height).

ü§î css flexbox ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è HOW does CSS Flexbox work?
    Parent-Child Concept: The container (parent) uses display: flex;, and its 
    direct children (flex items) automatically become flexible.
    Direction Control: Items can be arranged in a row or column using flex-direction.
    Alignment & Spacing: It helps distribute space effectively with properties like:
    justify-content: Aligns items horizontally.
    align-items: Aligns items vertically.
    align-self: Adjusts individual item alignment.
    flex-wrap: Allows items to wrap into multiple rows or columns if necessary.
    Flexibility in Sizing: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis control how items expand, shrink, or have a base width.


    WHY use CSS Flexbox?
    Problem it solves: Traditional CSS layout techniques like float, inline-block, 
    and positioning made it difficult to align elements responsively, especially in dynamic layouts.
    Why Flexbox?
    It provides a one-dimensional layout model for aligning items efficiently along a row or column.
    It automatically adjusts spacing, alignment, and responsiveness, making UI development easier.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î css grid ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è  WHY use CSS Grid?
  Problem it Solves
  Before CSS Grid, developers used float, inline-block, or Flexbox to create layouts.
  Flexbox is one-dimensional (row or column), making complex 2D layouts difficult.
  CSS Grid provides a two-dimensional layout system, allowing easy control over both rows and columns.

  WHAT are the key properties in CSS Grid?
      | Category	                         | Property	                               | Description
    | Container	                 |  display: grid;	                       | Enables grid layout.
                                  | grid-template-columns	                 | Defines column structure (e.g., 1fr 2fr).
                                  | grid-template-rows	                     | Defines row structure (e.g., 100px auto).
                                  | grid-template-areas	                   |  Names areas for easy placement.
                                  | gap or row-gap/column-gap	             |  Adds spacing between items.
    | Items	                     | grid-column / grid-row	                 | Defines placement (e.g., 1 / 3).
                                  | grid-area	                             |   Assigns an item to a named grid area.
    | Auto Layout	               | auto-fit & auto-fill	                   |   Adjusts the number of columns dynamically.
    | Alignment	                 | justify-content & align-content	       |    Controls overall grid alignment.
                                  |   justify-items & align-items	         |    Aligns individual grid items.

    When would you use CSS Grid instead of Flexbox?
    ‚úÖ Use CSS Grid for full-page layouts, dashboards, or magazine-style layouts.
    ‚úÖ Use Flexbox for navbars, buttons, and single-direction lists.

ü§î what is Difference between relative, absolute, fixed & sticky positioning in css ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è /* positions
    1. fixed
    2. sticky
    3. absolute
    4. relative
*/

/* top, left, right, bottom => distance from that direction
they only work with css postions */

/* relative ensures that the absolute element only moves within the parent element */

<div class="box1">
      <div class="imgForBox1">
        <img class="imgtag" src="https://me&k=20&c=horyU4NBswJFPSeVuEAlZtpB-BF_xFODzd4J4AbVH9M=" alt="">
        <h4 class="offer">50 % OFF upto 100</h4>
        <h4 class="time">38 min</h4>
      </div>
      <h2>Center point Restraurant </h2>
      <h3>Noth Indian, Chinese</h3>
      <hr>
      <h3>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eum, molestias quia.</h3>
</div>

.box1{
    border: 1px solid lightgray;
    width: 400px;
    margin: 20px auto;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 15px;
}

.imgtag{
    width: 100%;
    border-radius: 15px;
}

.imgForBox1{
    position: relative;
}

.offer{
    position: absolute;
    color: white;
    background-color: blue;
    bottom: 20px;
    left: 0;
    padding: 4px;
}

.time{
    position: absolute;
    background-color: lightgray;
    bottom: 20px;
    right: 10px;
    padding: 4px;
    border-radius: 4px;
}

  When would you use each?
  Use relative when you want an element to stay in the document flow but slightly adjust its position.
  Use absolute for elements that must be removed from the flow, like popups or tooltips.
  relative is given to parent element and child is given absolute.
  99% time relative and absolute go hand & hand.
  Use fixed for elements that should stay visible at all times, like a sticky navbar.
  Use sticky for elements that should start in the normal flow but become fixed when scrolling, like a sticky header.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î CSS box model, MBP ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è WHY: Why do we need the CSS Box Model?
    In web design, every element is represented as a rectangular box. 
    The CSS Box Model defines how these elements are sized, spaced, and positioned on a webpage. 
    Understanding it is crucial for proper layout design, spacing, and alignment of elements.

    Without the Box Model, you wouldn't be able to control padding, borders, or margins effectively.
    It helps in preventing layout issues when elements are placed next to each other. 

    Total width = Content width + Padding + Border + Margin

    Each element is treated as a box consisting of four layers: Content, Padding, Border, and Margin. 
    By default, box-sizing: content-box; is used, but using box-sizing: border-box; helps maintain fixed dimensions. 
    Understanding the Box Model is essential for responsive design, layout positioning, 
    and avoiding unexpected spacing issues."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î Pseudo-Elements & Pseudo-Classes ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è   1Ô∏è‚É£ Pseudo-Elements (::before, ::after)

      Definition: Pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an element without modifying the HTML.
      Syntax: Uses double colons (::) (but older browsers support single colon :).

      Example:
      /* Adds content before the element */
      p::before {
        content: "üëâ ";
        color: red;
      }

      /* Adds content after the element */
      p::after {
        content: " üëà";
        color: blue;
      }

      2Ô∏è‚É£ Pseudo-Classes (:hover, :nth-child, etc.)

      Definition: Pseudo-classes define a special state of an element (like when it's hovered, focused, or selected).
      Syntax: Uses single colon (:).

      Example:
      /* Changes text color when hovered */
      a:hover {
        color: green;
      }

      Common Pseudo-Classes:
        :hover
        :focus
        :nth-child(n)
        :first-child
        :last-child
        :not(selector)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î rem, em, %, px units ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è  "The units in CSS are essential for defining the size and layout of elements. 
    Each unit serves a different purpose, depending on the context. Let me break them down:

    px (Pixels):
    px is an absolute unit, meaning it represents a fixed size in pixels.
    It's independent of other settings like font-size or viewport size. 
    For example, width: 300px always means 300 pixels, regardless of the screen or user settings. 
    While it's great for pixel-perfect designs, it doesn't scale based on screen size, which can cause accessibility issues.

    % (Percentage):
    The % unit is a relative unit, 
    meaning it‚Äôs based on the parent element‚Äôs size. For instance, 
    if you set width: 50%, it will be 50% of the parent‚Äôs width. 
    This unit is extremely useful for responsive layouts because it scales dynamically with its container.
    However, if the parent doesn't have a defined size, the result may be unexpected.

    em (Relative to Parent's Font Size):
    em is a relative unit based on the font-size of the parent element.
    If the parent has a font-size of 16px, 1em equals 16px. 
    This unit is great when you want to create layouts that scale relative to the font size. However,
      it can sometimes cause issues because em values are inherited from the parent, so if you change the parent font size,
      it affects all child elements.

    rem (Relative to Root Font Size):
    rem stands for "root em" and is relative to the font-size of the root element (<html>). 
    If the root font size is 16px, 1rem will be 16px. 
    This unit is ideal when you need consistent scaling across the page because all elements 
    that use rem will scale uniformly based on the root font size. 
    It avoids the cascading issues seen with em and provides more control over the layout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î css animation & @keyframes ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è  CSS animations allow us to animate HTML elements, 
    providing smooth transitions between different states over time. 
    It makes elements move, change colors, resize, or fade in and out,
    creating dynamic and engaging web designs without needing JavaScript.

    There are two primary parts to CSS animations:

    The @keyframes Rule: The @keyframes rule defines the intermediate steps of an animation.
    It lets us specify how the element should look at various points throughout the animation process. 
    This rule lets us define states using percentages (e.g., 0% for the start and 100% for the end), 
    or specific times like from and to.

    For example:
    @keyframes moveBox {
        0% {
            left: 0;
            background-color: red;
        }
        50% {
            left: 50%;
            background-color: yellow;
        }
        100% {
            left: 100%;
            background-color: green;
        }
    }

    The animation Property: The animation shorthand property is used to apply the animation to an element. 
    It combines several individual properties like animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function,
    and others into one line of code.

    For example:
    .box {
        position: absolute;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        animation: moveBox 3s ease-in-out infinite;
    }
    This applies the moveBox animation, with a duration of 3s, easing applied to the movement, and repeating infinitely.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î Difference between inline, block, inline-block ?
üÖ∞Ô∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ Block Elements (display: block;)
        A block element takes up the full width available.
        It starts on a new line (pushing the next element to a new line).
        You can set width & height explicitly.

        Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <section>, <article>, etc.

        Always starts on a new line.
        Width is 100% by default (unless specified).
        Supports margin, padding, width, height.
        
        Edge Cases: If you don‚Äôt define a width, it stretches full width.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ Inline Elements (display: inline;)
        An inline element only takes up as much width as its content.
        It does NOT start on a new line (it stays within the same line).
        You cannot set width & height.

        Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <b>, etc.

        Stays on the same line with other elements.
        Does not accept width & height.
        Margins & padding only affect left & right (not top & bottom).

        Edge Cases: If you try width: 100px;, nothing happens!
                    Padding & margin (top/bottom) won't push elements away (it affects only left/right).
    
    3Ô∏è‚É£  Inline-Block Elements (display: inline-block;)
            Similar to inline, but supports width & height.
            Stays in the same line as inline elements.
            Allows block-like styling (width, height, margin, padding).

            Examples: <img>, <button>, <input>, <label>.

            Stays in the same line (like inline).
            Can set width & height (like block).
            Margins & paddings work in all directions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î @mediaQuery, resposivness ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è  What is a @media Query?
    @media query is a rule in CSS that enables the application of styles based on the environmental conditions of the device.
    For example, it can target a specific screen size, screen resolution, device orientation (portrait or landscape), and more.

  üìå Defining Media Queries:

      In a media query, we specify a condition (e.g., the width of the screen), 
      and if the condition is met, the enclosed CSS rules will be applied.

      @media (max-width: 768px) {
          /* Styles for devices with a screen width less than or equal to 768px */
          body {
              font-size: 14px;
          }
      }

  üìå Common Media Queries:

    Max-width/Min-width: Target devices based on their screen width.
    Orientation: Target portrait or landscape orientation.
    Resolution: Target different screen resolutions.

  üìåWhat is Responsiveness in CSS?
    Responsiveness refers to designing and coding a website so that it provides an optimal 
    viewing experience across a wide range of devices‚Äîsmartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

  üìåWhy Responsiveness is Important:

  Users now access websites from various devices, so it‚Äôs crucial for a website to adjust its layout,
  content, and design for smaller or larger screens.
  Responsiveness also contributes to better user experience, improved accessibility, and better performance across devices.

  üìåHow Responsiveness Works in CSS:

  By using @media queries, we can alter the layout, font sizes, padding, margins, 
  and other properties based on the screen's width, height, and other device characteristics.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î sticky Header & footer How  ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è    Certainly! A sticky header or footer remains fixed at the top or bottom of the viewport, 
    respectively, while the user scrolls through the content. This is commonly achieved using CSS,
    specifically with the position: sticky; property."

    üìåHow to Create a Sticky Header?

    header {
        position: sticky;
        top: 0;
        z-index: 1000;  /* Ensures the header stays on top of other elements */
        background-color: #333;
        color: white;
        padding: 10px;
        width: 100%;
    }

    üìåHow to Create a Sticky Footer?

    footer {
        position: sticky;
        bottom: 0;
        background-color: #333;
        color: white;
        padding: 10px;
        width: 100%;
    }

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î Difference between visibility: hidden, opacity:0 & display: none ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è üìåvisibility: hidden
    What It Does:

    The element becomes invisible, but it still takes up space in the layout.
    The element is present in the DOM, but you cannot see it.

    üìåopacity: 0
    What It Does:

    The element becomes fully transparent (invisible), but it still takes up space in the layout and remains interactive.
    This property affects the transparency of the element but not its presence in the document flow.

    üìådisplay: none
    What It Does:

    The element is completely removed from the layout.
    The element is not rendered, meaning it does not occupy any space in the document.
    The element is removed from the document flow entirely, so other elements will behave as if the hidden element does not exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î z-index ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è  üìåWhat is z-index?
    Definition: The z-index property in CSS is used to specify the stacking order of elements on a web page
    along the z-axis (the depth of the page). Elements with a higher z-index will appear in front of 
    those with a lower z-index. This is important when you have overlapping elements and you want 
    to control which one appears above the other.

    Context: The z-index only works on positioned elements 
    (i.e., elements that have position set to relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky). 
    It has no effect on static elements (the default positioning).

    üìåHow does z-index work?

    Stacking Context:
    When an element is positioned (i.e., position: relative, position: absolute, position: fixed, or position: sticky),
    it can have a z-index assigned to it.
    If an element is positioned, it creates a stacking context, 
    which means its z-index is relative to its sibling elements within the same stacking context, 
    not the entire document.
    Elements with the same z-index value are stacked in the order they appear in the HTML
    (i.e., the first element is placed below the second one).


    Positive and Negative z-index:
    Positive z-index: Elements with a higher z-index value will be stacked on top of elements with a lower z-index.
    Negative z-index: Elements with a negative z-index will be stacked behind elements with a z-index of 0 or positive values.

    .element1 {
        position: absolute;
        z-index: 1;
        top: 50px;
        left: 50px;
    }

    .element2 {
        position: absolute;
        z-index: 2;
        top: 100px;
        left: 100px;
    }

    In this example, .element2 will appear above .element1 because it has a higher z-index (2 vs 1).

    üìåWhy do we use z-index?
    Overlapping Elements: z-index allows us to control the layering of elements when they overlap.
    This is especially useful for elements like dropdowns,
    modals, or tooltips that need to be displayed above other content.
    Design and User Experience: It helps us manage the visual structure of a page, 
    ensuring that interactive elements like navigation menus or popups appear above static content without causing layout issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î what difference max-width, min-width, width ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è  width -> Sets an exact width. -> 	Fixed width, regardless of container.
  max-width -> Sets the maximum width the element can stretch to. -> Element's width is flexible but can't exceed the maximum value.
  min-width -> Sets the minimum width the element can shrink to. -> Element's width is flexible but can't be smaller than the minimum value.

    üìåWhy and How to Use Them?:
    Why use width: When you need a fixed, exact width for an element,
    especially when you don't want it to resize dynamically.

    Why use max-width: When you want an element to be flexible but not exceed a certain width
    (commonly used in responsive designs and for elements like images or containers that should not stretch too wide).

    Why use min-width: When you want to prevent an element from shrinking too small
    and becoming unusable or illegible (commonly used in forms, buttons, or flexible layouts).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î CSS variables ?

üÖ∞Ô∏è Certainly! CSS variables, also known as Custom Properties, allow you to store reusable values and
    use them throughout your stylesheet. They provide an easy way to manage and update values consistently across a site
    or application, improving maintainability and flexibility.

    üìåWhat are CSS Variables?
    Definition: CSS variables are entities defined using the -- prefix that hold values you can reuse throughout your CSS.
    They allow you to define values once and reference them multiple times in your CSS, 
    making your styles more dynamic and easier to maintain.

    Example:
    --variable-name: value;

    :root {
        --primary-color: #3498db;
        --font-size: 16px;
    }

    body {
        color: var(--primary-color);
        font-size: var(--font-size);
    }

    In the example above, the CSS variables --primary-color and --font-size are defined under :root (the global scope), 
    and then referenced using the var() function.

    üìåHow Do CSS Variables Work?
    Defining Variables:

    CSS variables are typically defined within the :root selector for global scope or within specific classes for scoped use. 
    This makes them reusable and accessible throughout the document.

    Global Scope (via :root):
    :root {
          --main-bg-color: #f0f0f0;
      }

    Local Scope:
    .container {
          --primary-bg: #ff5733;
           --box-size: 50px;
      }

      .box {
          width: var(--box-size); /* Will work if .box is within .container */
      }

      Fallback Values:
      You can provide fallback values in case a variable is undefined or invalid
      color: var(--primary-color, #000); /* #000 is the fallback value */
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§î Transition, Transform & animation ?

üÖ∞Ô∏èTransition ‚Üí Creates smooth changes between CSS property values over time.
  Transform ‚Üí Modifies an element‚Äôs shape, size, position, or rotation.
  Animation ‚Üí Creates keyframe-based animations that can change multiple properties over time.

  (A) CSS Transition
    Definition: The transition property allows elements to gradually change from one CSS style to another over a duration.

    element {
        transition: property duration timing-function delay;
      }

      property: The CSS property to animate (e.g., background-color, width, opacity).
      duration: Time (e.g., 0.5s, 1s) for the transition.
      timing-function: Defines how the transition progresses (ease, linear, ease-in-out).
      delay: (Optional) Specifies when the transition should start.

      Example: 
      .button {
          background-color: blue;
          transition: background-color 0.5s ease-in-out;
        }

        .button:hover {
          background-color: red;
        }


  (B) CSS Transform
    Definition: The transform property allows elements to be moved, rotated, scaled, or skewed in 2D or 3D space.

    transform: function(value);

    Common functions:
      translate(x, y): Moves an element.
      rotate(deg): Rotates an element.
      scale(x, y): Scales an element.
      skew(x, y): Skews an element.

      Example:
      .box {
          transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);   // The .box element is rotated 45 degrees and scaled 1.5 times.
        }

  (C) CSS Animation
      Definition: The @keyframes rule allows for more complex and multi-step animations without needing user interaction.

      @keyframes animation-name {
            0% { property: value; }
            50% { property: value; }
            100% { property: value; }
          }

          element {
            animation: animation-name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction;
          }


          animation-name: Name of the @keyframes.
          duration: How long the animation runs (e.g., 2s).
          timing-function: Defines speed (ease, linear).
          delay: (Optional) Delay before starting.
          iteration-count: How many times the animation runs (infinite for looping).
          direction: normal, reverse, alternate.

          Example:
          @keyframes slideIn {
              from {
                transform: translateX(-100%);
                opacity: 0;
              }
              to {
                transform: translateX(0);
                opacity: 1;
              }
            }

            .box {
              animation: slideIn 1s ease-out forwards;
            }

            The .box slides in from the left and fades in over 1s.
