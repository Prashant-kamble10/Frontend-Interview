🤔 custom hooks ?

🅰️ Custom Hooks:
When to use?: Extracting and reusing component logic.
Code: Functions prefixed with "use" returning stateful logic.
Why?: Enhances code organization, reusability, and readability.

🤔 cleaning cache, chunking, modularity, bundling ?

🅰️ Optimization Technique:

Cleaning Cache:
Clearing old stored files from browser or server memory to ensure users load the latest updated version of the application.

Chunking:
Splitting large application code into smaller pieces (chunks) to load only necessary parts, improving app loading speed and performance.

Modularity:
Breaking an application into small, independent, reusable components or files, making the code easier to develop, maintain, and scale.

Bundling:
Combining multiple JavaScript, CSS, and assets into a single or few files to reduce server requests and improve loading times.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🤔 lazy loading ?

🅰️ Lazy Loading:
Code splitting: Breaking down the application into smaller parts.
Chunking: Loading only the necessary code chunks.
Suspense: Pausing rendering until a component is ready.


What is Lazy Loading in React?
Lazy loading in React refers to the practice of delaying the loading of components until they are needed, 
typically when they enter the viewport or when a certain condition is met. This helps in optimizing the initial load time of a 
web application by splitting the code into smaller chunks and loading them on demand.

Why Lazy Loading is Done in React ?

    Lazy loading is implemented for several key reasons:

    Performance Optimization: By loading only the components that are needed initially, 
                    the initial load time of the application is reduced, leading to a faster, more responsive user experience.
    Reduced Bandwidth Usage: Users only download the necessary parts of the application, 
                    saving bandwidth, especially important for users with limited or slow internet connections.
    Improved User Experience: Faster load times and more responsive interfaces lead to a better overall user experience.
    Scalability: As applications grow larger, lazy loading helps manage the complexity and size of the application,
                    making it easier to maintain and scale.

How Lazy Loading is Done in React ?

React provides a built-in way to implement lazy loading using React.lazy and Suspense.

React.lazy: This function allows you to render a dynamic import as a regular component.

import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Dynamic Import: lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent')) dynamically imports the LazyComponent only when it is needed.
Suspense: Suspense is used to wrap the lazy-loaded component and provides a fallback UI (like a loading spinner)
while the component is being loaded.

React Router: If you are using React Router, you can lazy load route components.

import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

const Home = lazy(() => import('./Home'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./About'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
          <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        </Switch>
      </Suspense>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;

When to Use Lazy Loading in React ?

    You should consider using lazy loading in the following scenarios:

    Large Applications: When your application has many routes or components, lazy loading helps manage the application's 
                            size and improve performance.
    Heavy Components: Components that are large in size or have heavy dependencies should be lazy-loaded 
                            to avoid slowing down the initial load.
    Non-Essential Components: Components that are not immediately visible or critical to the initial rendering of the 
                            application can be lazy-loaded.
    Improving User Experience: To ensure that the most critical parts of the application load first,
                             providing a faster and smoother user experience.

Example Scenario

Consider a dashboard application with multiple heavy reports and analytics components. 
Initially, you only need to display a summary. You can lazy load the detailed report components so that they only load 
when the user navigates to them, keeping the initial load fast and efficient.

By implementing lazy loading strategically, you can significantly improve the performance and user experience of your React applications.

🤔 Higher order component ?

🅰️  What?: Functions that take a component and return an enhanced version.
    When?: Reuse component logic, share code, or manipulate component behavior.
    Why?: Promotes code reusability and separation of concerns.
    How?: Wrap a component with a function that adds or modifies its behavior.

    HOC: A function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props. 
            It is a pattern for reusing component logic.

Simple Example of a Higher Order Component (HOC):

// HOC: A function that takes a component and returns a new component
function withExtraInfo(WrappedComponent) {
  return function EnhancedComponent(props) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>This is extra info added by HOC!</h3>
        <WrappedComponent {...props} />
      </div>
    );
  };
}

// A basic component
function HelloComponent(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

// Wrap HelloComponent with the HOC
const EnhancedHello = withExtraInfo(HelloComponent);

// Usage inside App component
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <EnhancedHello name="John" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Very simple explanation you can tell to the interviewer:
        HOC is a function that takes a component (WrappedComponent) and returns a new component (EnhancedComponent).
        In this example, withExtraInfo adds a small heading above the original component.
        We pass all the original props using {...props} so that the original component still works as expected.
        EnhancedHello is now the wrapped version of HelloComponent with extra information.

Usage:
HOC: Useful for cross-cutting concerns where you need to add specific functionality to multiple components 
(e.g., logging, error handling, performance monitoring).

Reusability:
HOC: Enhances components by wrapping them, making it easy to apply common logic across different parts of the application. 
However, it can lead to "wrapper hell" if overused.

Performance:
HOC: Can potentially avoid unnecessary re-renders by controlling how props are passed 
down and when the wrapped component should update.

Ease of Debugging:
HOC: Can be harder to debug due to the additional layers of abstraction introduced by wrapping components.

When to Use
HOC:
When you need to reuse component logic across multiple components.
When you want to add additional behavior to components in a composable way (e.g., authorization checks, logging).

🤔 how can child component can modify the state variable of parent components ?

🅰️ Already done.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🤔 useContext, createContext, context-provider, user-context-consumer ?

🅰️ 1. How to explain Context API to an interviewer?
      Context API is a way in React to share data (like global variables) across many components without 
      having to pass props manually at every level (i.e., prop drilling).
      It provides a way to create global state that can be accessed and updated from any component inside your app.

        Best for themes, authentication, user settings, language (i18n), etc.

        It mainly involves 3 parts:

        Creating a context (React.createContext)
        Providing a context (<Context.Provider>)
        Consuming a context (useContext(Context))

    2. Fixed Steps to Implement Context API (Always remember like a formula 👇)
        ✅ Step 1: Create a Context
              const MyContext = React.createContext();

        ✅ Step 2: Create a Provider Component (where your data/state lives)
              const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
              const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

              return (
                <MyContext.Provider value={{ value, setValue }}>
                  {children}
                </MyContext.Provider>
              );
            };

        ✅ Step 3: Wrap your App (or component tree) with the Provider
              <MyProvider>
                  <App />
              </MyProvider>

        ✅ Step 4: Use the Context inside any component
              const { value, setValue } = useContext(MyContext);

    3. Simple Practical Example of Context API
        👉 Suppose you want to manage theme (light/dark) globally.

        ThemeContext.js

          import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from "react";

            // Step 1: Create Context
            const ThemeContext = createContext();

            // Step 2: Create Provider
            export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
              const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

              const toggleTheme = () => {
                setTheme((prev) => (prev === "light" ? "dark" : "light"));
              };

              return (
                <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
                  {children}
                </ThemeContext.Provider>
              );
            };

            // Step 3: Custom hook (Optional but clean)
            export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);

        App.js

            import React from "react";
            import { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from "./ThemeContext";

            const ThemedComponent = () => {
              const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();

              return (
                <div style={{ background: theme === "light" ? "#fff" : "#333", color: theme === "light" ? "#000" : "#fff", 
                height: "100vh" }}>
                  <h1>Hello, {theme} mode!</h1>
                  <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
                </div>
              );
            };

            export default function App() {
              return (
                <ThemeProvider>
                  <ThemedComponent />
                </ThemeProvider>
              );
            }
          
    4. Corner Cases around Context API (Common Interview Questions)

Corner Case -  Context only re-renders components that consume it, not the whole tree.	
Explanation - Only components calling useContext will update when context changes.

Corner Case - Splitting contexts for optimization	
Explanation - If you have multiple unrelated values, create multiple small contexts instead of one giant context.

Corner Case - Performance issue with large context values	
Explanation - If you pass huge objects in value, or change references unnecessarily, all consuming components will re-render.

Corner Case - useContext must be inside Provider	
Explanation - If you call useContext outside a <Provider>, you get undefined or an error.

Corner Case - Server-Side Rendering (SSR)	
Explanation - Context works in SSR like Next.js, but you need to initialize state properly.

Corner Case - Custom Hook abstraction	
Explanation - It's a best practice to wrap useContext inside a custom hook like useTheme() for clean usage.

Corner Case - Default Values	
Explanation - When you create context, you can optionally set a default value in createContext(defaultValue), 
                which will be used only if no Provider is found above in tree.

🤔 Redux, redux toolkit, Dispatch, slice, slicer, Action, Reducer, selector, subscribe, zustand ?

🅰️   1. How to explain Redux, Redux Toolkit, Dispatch, Slice, Slicer, Action, Reducer, Selector, Subscribe to interviewer?
          Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, where the entire app state is stored centrally
          in one store. Redux Toolkit, or RTK, is the official way to write Redux code, simplifying it with utilities 
          like createSlice() for slices and configureStore().

          An action is a plain object describing "what happened," and a reducer is a pure function that calculates the 
          new state based on actions. Dispatching an action triggers the reducer logic, updating the store.
          A slice combines related actions and reducers for a feature,  like a userSlice or cartSlice.
         
          Selectors are functions that extract specific data from the store. In React,
            we commonly use useSelector and useDispatch, which automatically handle subscriptions.

            Manual store.subscribe() is rare unless building something customized.

      2. Fixed Steps for Implementing Redux / Redux Toolkit
            ✅ Step 1: Install Redux Toolkit & React-Redux
                      npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

            ✅ Step 2: Create a Slice (features/userSlice.js)
                      import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
                        const userSlice = createSlice({
                          name: "user",
                          initialState: { name: "", age: 0 },
                          reducers: {
                            setName: (state, action) => { state.name = action.payload; },
                            setAge: (state, action) => { state.age = action.payload; }
                          }
                        });

                        export const { setName, setAge } = userSlice.actions;
                        export default userSlice.reducer;

            ✅ Step 3: Create a Store (app/store.js)
                      import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
                        import userReducer from "../features/userSlice";

                        export const store = configureStore({
                          reducer: {
                            user: userReducer
                          }
                        });

            ✅ Step 4: Wrap App with Provider (index.js)
                      import { Provider } from "react-redux";
                        import { store } from "./app/store";

                        <Provider store={store}>
                          <App />
                        </Provider>
            
            ✅ Step 5: Use useSelector and useDispatch (App.js)
                        import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
                        import { setName, setAge } from "./features/userSlice";

                        const App = () => {
                          const user = useSelector((state) => state.user);
                          const dispatch = useDispatch();

                          return (
                            <div>
                              <h1>{user.name} - {user.age}</h1>
                              <button onClick={() => dispatch(setName("Prashant"))}>Set Name</button>
                              <button onClick={() => dispatch(setAge(25))}>Set Age</button>
                            </div>
                          );
                        };

      3. What data and data type are required?

              Item	            Expected Type	                                Example
              Action	          Object { type, payload? }	                    {type: "increment", payload: 5}
              Reducer	          Pure function (state, action)	                (state, action) => {}
              Dispatch	        Function sending Action	                      dispatch(increment())
              useSelector	      Function to access store state	              (state) => state.counter.count
              Slice	            Object with name, initialState, reducers	
              Subscribe	        Function that listens to state changes manually

      4. Corner Cases and Interview Tips around Redux Toolkit

Corner Case - Immer.js is used internally
Explanation - Redux Toolkit allows "mutating state" in reducers because under the hood it uses Immer.js to keep it immutable.

Corner Case - No Direct State Mutation in Vanilla Redux
Explanation - If you are using old Redux without Toolkit, NEVER directly mutate state inside reducers.

Corner Case - Always slice your app properly
Explanation - Create feature-based slices instead of one huge reducer.

Corner Case - Minimal State
Explanation - Store only serializable and minimal state in Redux (no DOM nodes, class instances).

Corner Case - Thunks for async actions
Explanation - Use createAsyncThunk for async operations like API calls.

Corner Case - Subscribing manually is rare
Explanation - In React Redux apps, useSelector does the subscription automatically — manual store.subscribe() is rare.

Corner Case - DevTools integration
Explanation - configureStore automatically adds Redux DevTools integration.

Corner Case - Default Middleware
Explanation - Redux Toolkit store has thunk, serializableCheck, and immutableCheck middlewares by default.

Corner Case - Performance Issue
Explanation - Too much state in Redux store can cause unnecessary re-renders. Optimize with memo/useMemo.

🤔 useMemo ,useCallback, useRef ?

🅰️ 

🔴 1. useMemo  (Difference between React.memo and useMemo)
      What?
      useMemo memoizes (remembers) the result of a calculation.
      It recalculates only if the dependencies change.

      const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeSomething(a, b), [a, b]);

      When to use?
      When you have expensive calculations (heavy computations) inside a component that you don't want to re-run unnecessarily on every render.

      Why?
      To optimize performance by saving calculation time.
      Prevents recomputing something unless needed.

      Example:

      Without useMemo:
      const value = heavyCalculation(a, b);  // runs on every render 😩

      With useMemo:
      const value = useMemo(() => heavyCalculation(a, b), [a, b]);  // runs only when a or b change 😎

🔴 2. useCallback
      What?

      useCallback memoizes (remembers) the function itself.
      It returns the same function between renders if dependencies haven’t changed.

      When to use?
      When you pass functions as props to child components and you want to avoid re-creating functions unnecessarily.

      Why?
      To prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components (especially those wrapped with React.memo).

      Example:
      Without useCallback:

      const handleClick = () => {
        console.log("Clicked");
      };
      // handleClick gets created again on every render 😩

      With useCallback:

      const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
        console.log("Clicked");
      }, []);
      // handleClick remains the same unless dependencies change 😎

🔴 3. useRef
        What?
        useRef creates a mutable object { current: value } that persists across renders.
        It does NOT cause re-renders when updated.

        When to use?
        To store a DOM element reference (like focus an input).
        To persist some value across renders without causing re-render.
        To store previous values.

        Why?
        For accessing DOM nodes directly.
        For keeping mutable values without re-rendering the component.

        Example:

            DOM reference example:
            const inputRef = useRef();

            function focusInput() {
              inputRef.current.focus();
            }

            return <input ref={inputRef} />;

        Value storage example:

              const countRef = useRef(0);

              function handleClick() {
                countRef.current += 1;
                console.log(countRef.current); // updates but does not re-render
              }

🤔 DangeourslySetHTML ?

🅰️ WHAT is dangerouslySetInnerHTML?
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML is a React prop that allows you to directly inject raw HTML into a component.
    It is similar to innerHTML in vanilla JavaScript but comes with security risks.

    Example: Using dangerouslySetInnerHTML

    function MyComponent() {
        const htmlContent = "<h2 style='color:red;'>This is rendered as raw HTML</h2>";

        return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: htmlContent }} />;
    }

    📌 This will render the HTML inside the <div> instead of treating it as a string.

    WHY Do We Need dangerouslySetInnerHTML?
    ✔ Rendering HTML from External Sources – Sometimes, data from APIs, CMS, or Markdown parsers contain HTML.
    ✔ Displaying Pre-Formatted Content – Blogs, email templates, or rich-text editors require HTML rendering.
    ✔ SSR (Server-Side Rendering) or Pre-rendered Content – Some applications require injecting raw HTML dynamically.

    HOW Does It Work?
    Instead of using {someHtmlString}, we use { __html: someHtmlString }.
    The double underscore (__html) is a deliberate design choice by React to highlight potential security risks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🤔 React Folder structure ?

🅰️ 1. src/
    This is the main folder where all your application code resides. All JavaScript, CSS, 
    and other resources related to the app are typically found here.

            1.1 index.js (or index.tsx for TypeScript):
            This is the entry point of the React app. It renders the root component (usually App.js or App.tsx)
            into the root DOM element (often found in public/index.html).

            Example flow:
            ReactDOM renders the app component.
            The app component is the starting point for rendering the rest of the app's UI.

            1.2 App.js (or App.tsx):
            This is the root component of your application.
            It generally holds the main layout, routing logic (if you use React Router), and acts as a container for child components.
            The flow starts here. It renders different components based on user interactions, routing, etc.

            1.3 components/
            This folder holds all the reusable UI components in your application.
            Components can be functional or class-based. They accept props (inputs) and return JSX to render UI.

            Example:
            Button.js: A reusable button component.
            Navbar.js: A navigation bar component.
            Sidebar.js: A sidebar component.

            1.4 pages/:
            This folder holds the main views or pages of your app, like different routes.

            For example, if you're building a blog app, you might have:
            Home.js: Displays the homepage.
            Post.js: Displays an individual blog post.
            About.js: Displays information about the app or company.

            1.5 services/ (or sometimes api/):
            This folder contains functions to interact with external services or APIs (like a backend server).
            It’s usually a collection of functions that fetch data from an API, manage authentication, 
            or handle complex logic for interaction with backend services.

            Example:
            api.js: Contains functions like getPosts(), getUser(), etc.

            1.6 utils/:
            Contains helper functions or utilities that are used across the app.
            These can be reusable functions like:

            Formatting dates.
            Calculating sums or other business logic.

            1.7 styles/ (or css/ or scss/):
            This folder holds your styling files.
            You can either use regular CSS, SCSS for nested styles, or styled-components if you prefer CSS-in-JS.

            Example:
            App.css: Styles for the App.js component.
            Button.css: Styles for the Button.js component.

            1.8 context/ (if using Context API):
            If you're using Context API for state management, this folder will contain all the contexts and their providers.

            Example:
            UserContext.js: Provides user-related data (like authentication status) to the app.

            1.9 hooks/:
            Custom hooks are stored here, if you have any.
            Custom hooks allow you to reuse logic across components.

            Example:
            useFetch.js: A custom hook to fetch data from an API.

            1.10 assets/:
            This folder holds static files like images, icons, fonts, etc.

            Example:
            logo.png: The logo image for the app.

    2. public/:
            This folder contains the static files that are available publicly. These files don’t go through Webpack bundling.
            Files like index.html (the base HTML file), images, and favicon are stored here.
            index.html is the main HTML file that contains the root <div id="root"></div>, where your React app will be mounted.

🤔 <React.strictmode /> ?

🅰️ <React.StrictMode /> is a development tool that helps you catch bugs and follow best practices by identifying 
    unsafe or deprecated features in your React code. It doesn’t affect the user-facing part of your app but helps you ensure
    better code quality during development.

        import React from 'react';
        import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
        import App from './App';

        // Wrap the App component in <React.StrictMode>
        ReactDOM.render(
        <React.StrictMode>
            <App />
        </React.StrictMode>,
        document.getElementById('root')
        );

    What Happens Inside <React.StrictMode />:
        Warns about Deprecated Methods: It will warn you if you use lifecycle methods that are considered unsafe 
                    (like componentWillMount, componentWillReceiveProps, etc.).
        Double Invokes Certain Lifecycle Methods: For example, in development, it might call componentDidMount and useEffect
                twice to ensure components handle mounting and unmounting correctly. This doesn't happen in production.
        Checks for Refs: It checks for potential issues with refs and ensures they are used properly.

    Why Use It?
        It helps developers spot problems early and make their code more reliable.
        It also helps with improving your app’s performance and keeping it future-proof by preparing it for newer React features.
