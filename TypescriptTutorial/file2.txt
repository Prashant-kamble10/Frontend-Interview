2. Typescript is not what you think

🔍 What TypeScript is NOT:
TypeScript is not a completely new programming language.
It is not a standalone language — rather, it's a superset of JavaScript.
It does not replace JavaScript; it builds on top of it.

🔍 What TypeScript is:
It provides static type checking at compile-time.
It helps catch potential errors before code is run.
It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning all valid JS is also valid TS.

🧠 Key Concept – Static Checking:
Static checking = analyzing your code during development (not runtime).
Detects issues like:
    Accessing non-existent object properties.
    Type mismatches (e.g., adding a string to a number).
Similar to how languages like Java, Go provide compile-time checks.

⚠️ Misconceptions Cleared:
❌ TypeScript doesn’t stop you from exporting faulty code — it warns, not enforces.
❌ TypeScript doesn’t reduce code — it often requires more verbose code.

Example:

code 1,
let obj = {name: "prashant", age : 18}
let res = obj.user
console.log(res)

code 1 won't be getting converted to JS, It will straight away throw error.

code 2,
let num1 = 3;
let num2 = "3"
let res = num1 + num2
console.log(res)    // 22

code 2, You can still export and run that code in JavaScript — TS doesn’t stop you.
Adding "3" + 3 in TS may still transpile, unless stricter checks are manually enforced.

🛠️ Final Takeaways:
Think of TypeScript as a wrapper over JavaScript to help you write better, safer, and scalable code.
It introduces new concepts like interfaces, unions, etc., but all compile down to JS.
TS is optional but highly recommended for medium to large codebases.

5th - Number, boolean, type inference

Use TypeScript smartly by understanding when to use explicit type annotations and when to rely on TypeScript's type inference.

Type Inference:

TypeScript can automatically infer the type if a value is assigned during declaration.
Example: let userId = 334466 automatically infers the type as number, so : number is not required.
Overusing annotations (: type) when the value is already obvious is considered bad practice.

Best Practice Advice:

Don’t overuse type annotations when the value makes the type obvious.
Let TypeScript handle inference where it can.
Use explicit types only when necessary (e.g., complex structures or for clarity in function arguments/return types).

6th - Don't use ANY in typescript

Why any is problematic:

If you don't explicitly define a type, TypeScript may infer any, which means it won't enforce type safety.

Example: A variable declared without a clear return type (e.g., from a function like getHero()) will default to any,
allowing any kind of value (string, boolean, number, etc.) to be assigned 
to it later — leading to inconsistent and error-prone code.

Summary Message:

Avoid using any in TypeScript. It removes the benefits of type safety, 
leads to unpredictable code, and is discouraged in both best practices and official documentation. 
Use explicit types and enable noImplicitAny for safer, maintainable code.
