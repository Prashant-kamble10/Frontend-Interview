1. Why to learn Typescript.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript,
→ This means all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code.

JavaScript is a subset of TypeScript,
→ Yes, this follows from the above.

TypeScript throws errors at compile time, not at runtime.
The TypeScript compiler (tsc) checks your code before running it.
At runtime, the code is already converted (transpiled) to plain JavaScript, which does not include type information.

TypeScript brings type safety,
→ It helps catch type-related bugs during development (at compile time), not runtime.

Odd behaviour of JavaScript

2 + "2" => 22
null + 2 => 2
undefined + 2 => NaN

In the above different types successfully completing there operations, which shouldn't happen.
Exactly this odd behaviour is stopped by the TS.
